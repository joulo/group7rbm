original rbm.py is commented there:
http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rbm.html

utils.py is from:
http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/utilities.html#how-to-plot

logistic_sgd.py is from:
http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/logreg.html

rbm_plots*/ and rbm_data*/ directories are results created by rbm.py
The right place for these would be ../results/ directory, so they
are moved there and code had been updated so it creates them there.
